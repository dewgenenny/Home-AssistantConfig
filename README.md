# Home-AssistantConfig

![alt text]https://travis-ci.org/dewgenenny/Home-AssistantConfig.svg?branch=master

This is the backup of my Home Assistant config. Home Assistant (https://home-assistant.io/) is an awesome home automation software that allows you to automate pretty much everything.

So far I have following components integrated:

Xiaomi Button, Movement Sensor, Plug
Ikea Tradfri lights
MAX! Individual radiator thermostats
Xeoma wireless cameras (Video + Movement sensor (https://github.com/dewgenenny/trigger-sensor))
Octoprint
Plex, Kodi, Chromecast, Yamaha receiver
Broadlink IR receiver (only half working)
External light sensor (ESP8266 via MQTT) (used to match hallway lights to same brightness)
External temperature/humidity sensor (ESP8266 via MQTT)

This is very much a work in progress..... :)
